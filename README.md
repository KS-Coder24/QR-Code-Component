## Overview
This project involved creating a QR Code Component by following a structured process to ensure accuracy and adherence to design specifications. The key steps included examining images for key features, reviewing and modifying HTML, consulting Figma designs for precise image dimensions, and styling with CSS while maintaining design integrity.

## My process
The process I undertook is as follows:

First, I thoroughly examined the images to identify and document the key features that needed to be incorporated.

Next, I reviewed the existing HTML code and made necessary adjustments to cater for the identified key features. This included structuring the HTML to ensure it was semantically correct and ready for styling.

I then consulted the Figma designs to determine the precise dimensions of the images. These dimensions were essential for ensuring that the images displayed correctly, and I integrated these measurements into the HTML code accordingly.

Then styling with CSS, I constantly refer back to the Figma designs and design systems. This ensured that all elements were styled according to the specified dimensions and visual guidelines, maintaining consistency and design integrity.

Finally, I validated the code using the W3C validator to ensure there were no issues. This step confirmed that the code met all web standards and was free of errors.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Figma

### What I learned

This project gave me valuable practice coding with HTML and CSS. I learned how to use Flexbox for arranging elements and how to include fonts from Google Fonts. I also practiced creating responsive designs by using media queries to adjust the layout for different screen sizes. I was also able to navigate within Figma to get the dimensions of key objects. The other thing I did was hide a section of the page that gave credit to the challenge and the coder. I used CSS to make sure this section doesn’t show up on the page. This helped me learn how to control what parts of a webpage are visible or hidden.

I am highlighting this below:

```html
<div class="attribution">
      Challenge by <a href="https://www.frontendmentor.io?ref=challenge" target="_blank">Frontend Mentor</a>. 
      Coded by <a href="#">KS_Coder</a>.
    </div>
```
```css
.attribution { 
    font-size: 11px; 
    text-align: center; 
    display: none;
  }
```

### Continued development

In the future, I plan to focus on improving my skills with CSS Grid and HTML tables, as well as exploring more advanced styling techniques. I want to gain a deeper understanding of how to create complex layouts using Grid and how to effectively use tables for presenting data. Additionally, I aim to refine my styling abilities to make web pages look even better and to enhance my overall design skills. Practicing these areas will help me build more versatile and polished web projects.
